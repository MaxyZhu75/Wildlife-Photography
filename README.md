# :bear: Wildlife Photography
We used Unity to create a 3D video game involving the forest scene which includes elements like diverse wild animals, plants, rocks, etc. In order to help biologists at UMass do research about forest biodiversity, we are controlling a wildlife photographer in this game, and he is about to hang around to capture animal photos in the forest to earn points in a limitted time. At the same time, he is supposed to avoid encountering beasts straightforward (like bears, wolves, eagles). The response of NPCs would be defined by behavior trees. For instance, when encountering human character, rabbits will run away, but bears may attack with probability. The grading algorithm for each round mainly based on factors like occulusion, camera focal length, animal species, etc. Our target audience would be children and teenagers. We hope this game can provide them a connection to nature, help them have a basic understanding of various animal species, and teach them respect for wild animals.
